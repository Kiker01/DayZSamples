# DayZSamples
These are weapon samples for DayZSA 

This is intended to be a learning resource for new modders tryna learn dey wey. 


I'm not a mega expert, but these samples should be better than most unbinarized P3D's out there. They should at least go pew-pew.


WARNING: this might piss off Mikero's tools. Eventually I will go in and clean up the folders, but for now this is a working version that can be packed and binarized with AddOn Builder.
